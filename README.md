Cpp Practice Questions

Ques 1. You are building a Car class in C++ that simulates a simple car system. The class should encapsulate the following attributes:

brand (string): The car's brand name.
model (string): The car's model name.
year (int): The manufacturing year of the car.
speed (int): The current speed of the car.
The class should provide:

A constructor to initialize the brand, model, and year.
Getters for all attributes.
Setters for speed only (you should not allow external modification of the brand, model, or year).
A method to increaseSpeed(int amount) that increases the current speed by a given amount.
A method to decreaseSpeed(int amount) that decreases the current speed, but the speed should never go below 0.
Task:

Implement the Car class with proper encapsulation.
Create a main function where you create an object of the Car class, modify its speed using the provided methods, and print the car's details after each speed change.
